# Titanic-analysis
 Academic project for the semester.

In this project I did basic analysis and visualisation of the Titanic catastrophe data downloaded from Kaggle. I used Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn libraries for making the charts, reading the data as table and counting the values. 

Later In the Data Exploration I'll add the application for the user to dig into this csv file by themselves.
