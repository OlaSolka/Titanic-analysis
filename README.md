# Titanic-analysis
 Academic project for the semester.

In this project I did basic analysis and visualisation of the Titanic catastrophe data downloaded from Kaggle. I used Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn libraries for making the charts, reading the data as table and counting the values. In every section you'll find a description for the specific part. 

In second section you'll find a simple app for exploring this big database. I included some of the most interesting statistics and charts to this program. 

I'll make sure to work some more on the code in the future to make it more complex.

disclaimer: I put my own file path, so it only works locally on my computer.
